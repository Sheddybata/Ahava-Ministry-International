<p><strong>2</strong> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> And God said, "Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water."</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> God called the vault "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.</p>`

<p><strong>4</strong> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</p>
