# Leaderboard Testing Guide

## What I've Fixed

1. **Podium Heights**: Fixed the ranking display so 1st place is tallest, 2nd place medium, 3rd place shortest
2. **Real Data Connection**: Connected leaderboard to database with proper data transformation
3. **Mock Data Fallback**: Added mock data when database is empty for testing
4. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to troubleshoot data issues

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Immediate Testing)
The leaderboard now shows mock data when your database is empty:
- Faithful John: 25 days streak
- Prayerful Mary: 18 days streak  
- Devoted David: 12 days streak
- Blessed Sarah: 8 days streak
- Graceful Anna: 5 days streak

### Option 2: Add Real Database Data
1. Run `add_test_users.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Run `update_user_statistics_view.sql` to update the view
3. The leaderboard will show real user data with actual streaks

## Expected Results

✅ **Podium Display**:
- 1st place (left): Tallest podium with 25 days
- 2nd place (center): Medium podium with 18 days
- 3rd place (right): Shortest podium with 12 days

✅ **Real Streak Numbers**: The podium should now show actual day counts instead of "0 days"

✅ **Debug Information**: Check browser console for detailed logging about data loading

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "0 days":
1. Check browser console for debug logs starting with 🏆
2. Verify your database has users with `current_streak > 0`
3. Make sure the `user_statistics` view is updated with the SQL scripts provided

The leaderboard is now fully connected to show real streak data! 🎯
